== Large Language Models (LLMs) Introduction

AI/ML and specifically Large Language Models (LLM) for generative AI (GenAI) has been the hottest topic in the application development world since 2023 and the birth of OpenAI's ChatGPT on November 30 2022.

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer[GPT] and specifically the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)[transformer architecture] has produced models that are incrediby capable at natural language processing (NLP) tasks making them ideally suited for conversational interactive user experience and the Hello World for an LLM is a chatbot.

In this module we will introduce you to a new template that provisions both the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) and the MDLC (Model Development Lifecycle). Where the SDLC is implemented as a Tekton-based Trusted Application Pipeline as seen in previous modules and the MDLC is implemented as a Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) pipeline based on Kubeflow. 

Where RHOAI is responsible for the LLM serving, management, and monitoring.  

Where RHTAP + RHDH is responsible for the application code pipeline and lifecycle.  

Note: LLMs take a fair bit of time to "spawn" within their pod, use the cooking show technique by running the template once BEFORE taking the stage, before sharing your screen.
